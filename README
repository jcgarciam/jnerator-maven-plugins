This is project aims to provide generators as maven plugins, to speed up developments.

Initial generator is a forked from the discontinued project SaltoDB at (http://salto-db.sourceforge.net/salto-db-generator/index.html). The idea is to provide the same supported generator as Maven plugins under the name 'jnerator-persistence-maven-plugin' targeting the following artifacts :

  - Salto-db (inherited from original source code
  - EJB3
  - Hibernate
  - EJB3 and Hibernate DAOs
  - EJB3, Hibernate DAOs and Junit tests
  - Pojos and Hibernate DAOs
